        <h2>Implemented Model</h2>
        <p>
            This system is developed using logistic regression, a widely used model for binary classification in machine learning. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class.
        </p>
        <div class="model-equations">
            <p>
                <span class="equation">f(w, b(x)) = g(w · x + b)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="equation">g(z) = 1 / (1 + e<sup>-z</sup>)</span>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="model-details">
            <h3>Objective:</h3>
            <p>Find the optimal values for the parameters (w, b) that provide accurate class probabilities.</p>

            <h3>Forward Pass:</h3>
            <p>Compute the linear combination of input features x with the weight vector w and the bias term b.</p>
            <p>Apply the sigmoid function to the result:</p>
            <p>Z = x ⋅ w + b</p>
            <p>A = σ(Z)</p>

            <h3>Cost Function:</h3>
            <p>Measure the error between predicted probabilities and true labels using binary cross-entropy loss:</p>
            <p>J(w, b) = -1/m ∑[y<sub>i</sub> log(f<sub>w,b</sub>(x<sub>i</sub>)) + (1-y<sub>i</sub>) log(1-f<sub>w,b</sub>(x<sub>i</sub>))]</p>

            <h3>Backward Pass (Gradient Computation):</h3>
            <p>Calculate the gradients of the cost function with respect to parameters (w, b):</p>
            <p>∂J/∂b = 1/m ∑(f<sub>w,b</sub>(x<sub>i</sub>) - y<sub>i</sub>)</p>
            <p>∂J/∂w = 1/m ∑(f<sub>w,b</sub>(x<sub>i</sub>) - y<sub>i</sub>)x<sub>i</sub></p>

            <h3>Training Process:</h3>
            <p>Update parameters (w, b) using an optimization algorithm (e.g., gradient descent):</p>
            <p>w ← w - α ∂J/∂w</p>
            <p>b ← b - α ∂J/∂b</p>

            <h3>Iteration:</h3>
            <p>Iterate through the training process, performing forward and backward passes, to minimize the cost function.</p>
